html &amp; css practice from scratch

***Need to remember to only use the class selector when you are able to use a style on multiple elements. The ID tag should be used for specific elements**
Complete but issues:
1) Updating readme through here threw off the merge between local and remote, don't know why but now I can't update push from terminal. Need to look into this.
2) Remember to only use classes when necessary
3) Not sure how to add a responsive image with margins on either end.
